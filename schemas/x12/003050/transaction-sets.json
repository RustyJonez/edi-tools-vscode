The student transcript is used by schools and school districts and by post-secondary educational institutions to transmit current and historical records of educational accomplishments and other significant information for students enrolled at the sending schools and institutions. The transcript may be sent to other educational institutions, to other agencies, or to prospective or current employers.  When a student transfers from one educational institution to another, it is essential that the student's prior educational record be made available to the institution to which the student wishes to transfer. For students in Pre-Kindergarten through Grade 12, prompt records transfer will assist receiving schools in making an appropriate initial educational placement of student. It is important that this information be available on a timely basis. In some cases for post-secondary students, it is this record which determines whether the student will be accepted at the receiving institution. In all cases, it is important to know what course work the student has already completed so that the student may be properly placed in courses and educational programs at the next institution.  When a student seeks employment or wishes to inform another agency of the student's academic accomplishments, the student transcript may be sent to a prospective employer, branch of the military, or another government agency.  The student transcript contains personal history and identifying information about the student, the current academic status, dates of attendance, courses completed with grades earned, degrees and diplomas awarded, health information (Pre-Kindergarten through Grade 12 only), and testing information."

This information includes, but is not limited to, student and applicant identification, school enrollment data, borrowing history, and the terms of the loan.  The student loan application process typically begins with an applicant submitting a student loan application to the financial aid officer at the student's school. The financial aid officer adds school-related information and certifies the application. The school then forwards the loan application to the lender for review. If the review is satisfactory, the lender adds information to the application, approves the loan, and forwards the application to the guarantor. The guarantor reviews the lender-approved application and if appropriate, issues a guarantee. The lender disburses the loan proceeds when a guarantee is received."

After the lender receives a loan guarantee approval, the federally required loan disclosure is generated, and the loan proceeds are disbursed.

For the purpose of this standard, the sponsor is the party or entity that ultimately pays for the coverage, benefit or product. A sponsor can be an employer, union, government agency, association, or insurance agency.  The payer refers to an entity that pays claims, administers the insurance product or benefit, or both. A payer can be an insurance company, health maintenance organization (HMO), preferred provider organization (PPO), government agency (Medicare, Medicaid, Champus, etc.), or an entity that may be contracted by one of these former groups.  For the purpose of the 834 transaction set, a third party administrator (TPA) can be contracted by a sponsor to handle data gathering from those covered by the sponsor if the sponsor does not elect to perform this function itself."

The transaction set can be used to transmit or request specifications or technical information between trading partners. It can be used to transmit engineering change and engineering change requests. It can also be used to allow EDI trading partners the ability to exchange a complete or partial technical description of a product, process, service, etc. over the same path as any other EDI transaction. The detail area can include graphic, text, parametric, tabular, image, spectral, or audio data. A transmission includes identification information to assist the receiver in interpreting and utilizing the information included in the transaction.  Further action as a consequence of the receipt and initial processing of the specification or other technical data may or may not require human intervention. The transmission and receipt of the data may require private agreement between the trading partners to automate the receipt of the data.  The total transaction must be in the general form of all ASC X12 transactions so that an EDI computer system will be able to automatically recognize it as a Specification/Technical Information Transaction Set and pass it on for processing of the data itself. The transaction set is not media dependent.  The detail area of the Specification/Technical Information Transaction Set provides a structure which allows for the exchange of a variety of specification information. For example, if the transaction contains information describing a complete assembly, it would be necessary to include the assembly model, the models for each of the individual parts, and the associated specifications. In the case of a process it may be necessary to transmit the specification of the product along with the specifications of the process and raw materials. This transaction set can also be linked to other transaction sets.  This transaction set is not limited to a specific transmission protocol and uses other standards as applicable where they do not conflict with these requirements for specification transaction."

The transaction set can be used to communicate chemical characteristics, hazards, and precautions for the safe handling and use of a material. The transaction set is intended to convey the information required for a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) as defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200 in the United States, and Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHIMS) in Canada, and various state, province, and local requirements under right-to-know legislation.  The MSDS provides the receiver with detailed information concerning material identity, emergency response, chemical and physical characteristics, toxicology, and industrial hygiene procedures.  State and federal law dictate who is obligated to provide the MSDS and to whom it should be issued. In addition, third-party providers or others with no statutory obligation may voluntarily provide an MSDS to anyone.  This transaction set allows for transmission of MSDS data in a structured, unstructured, or semi-structured form.  CAUTION: With this transaction set, text format is critical due to the MSDS's primary role as a vehicle for hazards communication. The risk if this information is not transmitted clearly and accurately could be harmful to human life, harmful to the environment, could cause mishandling of product, could result in regulatory non-compliance, and could result in liability.  Trading partners need to agree on how to interpret, store, and display/print MSDS text, especially text contained in the MSG and SD1 segments. For example, a sender may wish to format text so that one print line is mapped to one MSG segment. Segment terminator and data element delimiter characters shall not appear in any MSDS data.  WARNING: Alteration of the original document will occur if the EDI translator or application software converts characters to uppercase. This may adversely affect the appearance, effectiveness, clarity, readability, and communicability of the printed MSDS document."

This transaction set provides the recipient of a shipment with data for both receipt planning and payment generation.  EDI and telecommunications technologies suggest efficiencies in the way business data is processed. For example, the sender of a shipment may send the recipient's receiving function a Ship Notice/Manifest (856), and the payables function an Invoice (810), even though the contents of these two documents may be largely redundant. In certain business environments, the Shipment and Billing Notice permits the consolidation of these two documents into one.  Specifically, this transaction set is appropriate where the shipment data, when it includes terms and item prices, can be used both to plan receipts and to generate payment. In this environment, the exact prices for the items shipped may not be known in advance by both parties. This transaction set is not appropriate in so-called Evaluated Receipts Settlement (ERS) environments, in which the exact prices for the items shipped have been agreed upon by, and are known to, both parties in advance.
