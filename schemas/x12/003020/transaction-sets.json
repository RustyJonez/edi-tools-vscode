    "description": "This standard provides the format and establishes the data contents of the Specifications/Technical Information transaction set. This transaction set can be used to transmit specifications or technical information between trading partners. It can be used to allow EDI trading partners the ability to exchange a complete or partial technical description of a product, process, service, etc. over the same path as any other EDI transaction. The detail area can include graphic, text, parametric, tabular, image, spectral, or audio data. A transmission includes identification information to assist the receiver in interpreting and utilizing the information included in the transaction.  Further action as a consequence of the receipt and initial processing of the specification or other technical data may or may not require human intervention. The transmission and receipt of the data may require private agreement between the trading partners to automate the receipt of the data.  The total transaction must be in the general form of all ASC X12 transactions so that an EDI computer system will be able to automatically recognize it as a Specification/Technical Information Transaction Set and pass it on for processing of the data itself. The transaction set is not media dependent.  The detail area of the Specification/Technical Information Transaction Set provides a structure which allows for the exchange of a variety of specification information. For example, if the transaction contains information describing a complete assembly, it would be necessary to include the assembly model, the models for each of the individual parts, and the associated specifications. In the case of a process it may be necessary to transmit the specification of the product along with the specifications of the process and raw materials. This transaction set can also be linked to other transaction sets.  This transaction set in not limited to a specific transmission protocol and uses other standards as applicable where they do not conflict with these requirements for specification transaction."

This transaction set is used to communicate chemical characteristics, hazards, and precautions for the safe handling and use of a material. The transaction set is intended to convey the information required for a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) as defined by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard, 29 CFR 1910.1200 in the United States, and Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHIMS) in Canada, and various state, province, and local requirements under Right-to-Know legislation.  The MSDS provides the receiver with detailed information concerning material identity, emergency response, chemical and physical characteristics, toxicology, and industrial hygiene procedures.  State and federal law dictate who is obligated to provide the MSDS and to whom it should be issued. In addition, third-party providers or others with no statutory obligation may voluntarily provide an MSDS to anyone.  This transaction set allows for transmission of MSDS data in a structured, unstructured, or semi-structured form.  CAUTION: With this transaction set, text format is critical due to the MSDS's primary role as a vehicle for hazards communication. The risk if this information is not transmitted clearly and accurately could be be harm to human life, harm to the environment, mishandling of product, regulatory non-compliance, and liability.  Trading partners need to agree on how to interpret, store, and display/print MSDS text, especially text contained in the MSG and SD1 segments. For example, a sender may wish to format text so that one print line is mapped to one MSG segment. Segment terminator and data element delimiter characters shall not appear in any MSDS data.  WARNING: Alteration of the original document will occur if the EDI translator or application software converts characters to uppercase. This may adversely affect the appearance, effectiveness, clarity, readability, and communicability of the printed MSDS document."

This transaction set provides the recipient of a shipment with data for both receipt planning and payment generation.  EDI and telecommunications technologies suggest efficiencies in the way business data is processed. For example, the sender of a shipment may send the recipient's receiving function a Ship Notice/Manifest (856), and the payables function an Invoice (810), even though the contents of these two documents may be largely redundant. In certain business environments, the Shipment and Billing Notice permits the consolidation of these two documents into one.  Specifically, this transaction set is appropriate where the shipment data, when it includes terms and item prices, can be used both to plan receipts and to generate payment. In this environment, the exact prices for the items shipped may not be known in advance by both parties. This transaction set is not appropriate in so-called Evaluated Receipts Settlement (ERS) environments, in which the exact prices for the items shipped have been agreed upon by, and are known to, both parties in advance.  The Shipment and Billing Notice distinguishes two hierarchies of shipment data. The first hierarchy is for shipments in which multiple vendor's items are contained within the same packaging (pallet, pack or subpack). This hierarchy is Shipment, Order, Packaging, Item. The second hierarchy is for shipments in which each package (pallet, pack, or sub-pack) contains only one vendor's item. This hierarchy is Shipment, Order, Item, Packaging.  This transaction set is not to be used to replace the Ship Notice/Manifest (856) or Invoice (810) individually, but only to replace both, together. For example, do not use this transaction set in place of a Ship Notice/Manifest while continuing to send either paper or electronic invoice."
